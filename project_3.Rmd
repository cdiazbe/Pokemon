## Introduction

The Pokémon with Stats dataset, available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abcsds/pokemon/data, shows data for each Pokémon, including its name, type(s), and battle-related statistics. The following analysis will be performed: 

* Assess whether Pokémon tend to be stronger in attack-oriented or defense-oriented statistics across Pokémon types
* Determine whether dual-type Pokémon have higher overall battle-related statistics compared to single-type Pokémon

```{r, eval=FALSE}
pokemon<-read_csv("data/Pokemon.csv")
```

### Aim 1
```{r, echo=FALSE}
aim1<-readRDS(here::here("output/aim1.rds"))

aim1%>%
  knitr::kable(digits=2,
               col.names=c("Pokémon Type", "Mean Attack", "Mean Defense", "Stronger Stat"),
               align="c",
               caption="Table 1: Comparison of Attack- and Defense-Oriented Statistics Across Pokémon Types")%>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(
    full_width=FALSE,
    font_size=14)
```

Table 1 shows that most Pokémon types have higher attack-oriented statistics, while a smaller number of types, including Bug, Fairy, Ghost, Rock, and Steel, tend to have higher defense-oriented statistics. Among all Pokémon types, Dragon exhibits the highest mean attack-oriented statistics, whereas Steel exhibits the highest mean defense-oriented statistics.

### Aim 2

```{r, echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("output/aim2.png"))
```

Figure 2 shows the variation in total battle statistics among single- and dual-type Pokémon, with dual-type Pokémon typically having higher overall statistics than single-type Pokémon.
